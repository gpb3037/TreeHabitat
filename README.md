Habitat suitability analysis for the Colorado Blue Spruce

Areas of focus (find GEOID codes vis https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html#cou)
Primary - Boulder County, Colorado  (GEOID 08013)
Secondary, based upon similar characteristics to Boulder County

Taos County, New Mexico (GEOID 35055)
Elevation: 5,000 to 13,000 feet.
Climate: Cold winters and monsoon-driven precipitation.
Features: Shares a focus on natural land conservation and mountainous terrain.

Albany County, Wyoming (GEOID 56001)
Elevation: Ranges from around 5,000 to 13,000 feet.
Climate: Similar to Boulder County with cold winters and a combination of alpine and montane zones.
Vegetation: Forested areas with suitable conditions for blue spruce, particularly around the Medicine Bow Range.
Land Use: Mixed urban (Laramie) and wilderness areas like the Medicine Bow National Forest, which supports blue spruce.

Blue spruce (Picea pungens) is also called Colorado blue spruce, 
Colorado spruce, silver spruce, and pino real.

Digital Elevation Model -
##### SRTM or the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was started 1999 onboard the Endeavour and collected data for 11 days. As the orbit of the shuttle was not circumpolar but sinusoidal it was only possible to  cover a small portion of the earth surface. The shuttle therefore used the reflection of emitted radar signals in the so-called C-band (wavelength 5.6 cm) for the SIR-C sensor developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the X-band (wavelength 3.1 cm) for the X-SAR sensor developed by the German Aerospace Agency. The mission was clear: map the world!
